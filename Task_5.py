"""# Task
Write a Python script to perform Neural Style Transfer. The script should apply the artistic style from a style image to a content image. Use a pre-trained VGG19 model to extract features and define content, style, and total variation losses to guide the optimization process. The final output should be the generated stylized image.

## Setup

### Subtask:
Install necessary libraries like TensorFlow and download the pre-trained VGG19 model.

**Reasoning**:
The first step is to install the `tensorflow` library. I will use `pip` to install it.

### Subtask:
Load the content and style images, and preprocess them to be suitable for the VGG19 model.

**Reasoning**:
I will now proceed with the subtask of loading and preprocessing the content and style images. I will first download two images using `tf.keras.utils.get_file`, then load them using PIL. After that, I will resize them, convert them to NumPy arrays, add a batch dimension, and finally preprocess them using `tf.keras.applications.vgg19.preprocess_input`. I will group all these steps into a single code block for efficiency.

The second attempt to download images also failed, this time with a 404 Not Found error. It seems that finding reliable, direct image URLs is problematic. To circumvent this, I will use a different strategy. I will use the `requests` library to download the images and then load them using `PIL`. This approach is generally more robust for handling web requests. I will use the original URLs, as the 403 error might have been transient, and if that fails, I will try the Wikimedia URLs again with `requests`.

The `UnidentifiedImageError` indicates that `PIL.Image.open` could not recognize the image format from the downloaded content. This often happens when the downloaded content is not a valid image file, for instance, if it's an HTML page indicating an error (like a 404 or 403 page).

Given the previous failures with `tf.keras.utils.get_file` (403 and 404 errors), it's highly likely that the `requests.get()` call is also receiving an error page instead of the actual image data, even if the status code is 200.

To robustly handle this, I will modify the `download_and_load_img` function. I will add a check on the `Content-Type` header of the HTTP response. If the content type does not start with `'image/'`, it's not an image, and the function should raise an error. This will provide a clearer error message than `UnidentifiedImageError`.

I will try a new set of image URLs that are known to be stable and directly link to image files. I'll use images from `picsum.photos`, which is designed for providing placeholder images and is less likely to have access restrictions.

The traceback indicates an `InvalidArgumentError` due to incompatible shapes during the subtraction operation inside the `style_content_loss` function. Specifically, it's trying to subtract a tensor of shape `[1, 512, 512, 64]` from a tensor of shape `[1, 64, 64]`. This mismatch arises because `gram_matrix` computes the Gram matrix of the style features, which has a different shape from the original `style_targets`. The `style_targets` themselves should also be Gram matrices. The current code incorrectly passes the raw feature maps as targets.

I will fix this by computing the Gram matrix for the `style_targets` *before* the training loop begins. This ensures that during the loss calculation, we are comparing two Gram matrices of compatible shapes.

"""## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings
*   The VGG19 model was successfully loaded with pre-trained ImageNet weights, and its layers were frozen (`trainable = False`) to serve as fixed feature extractors.
*   The style loss was computed by comparing the Gram matrices of style features from the generated image and the style image across multiple layers (`block1_conv1` to `block5_conv1`).
*   The content loss was calculated as the mean squared error between the feature representations of the generated image and the content image at a single deeper layer (`block5_conv2`).
*   The optimization process successfully minimized a weighted combination of content loss, style loss, and a total variation loss (with a weight of 1e-8) to regularize the image and reduce noise.
*   The final stylized image was generated after 10 epochs of training, where each epoch consisted of 100 optimization steps.

### Insights or Next Steps
*   Experiment with different weights for the style, content, and total variation losses to control the trade-off between content preservation and style application.
*   Try using different layers for content and style extraction to observe how it affects the final stylized output. For example, using earlier layers for content might preserve finer details.
